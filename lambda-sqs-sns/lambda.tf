// serverless
// serverless means the developers no need to manage the servers
// servers will be managed by AWS
// developers just need to provide the code (function) with some basic settings
// it doesn't mean that there are no servers. Just no need to manage the servers

// Serverless services
// Lambda, Glue, Step Functions, DynamoDB, SNS and SQS, Aurora serverless, S3 etc.

// AWS Lambda
// No need to manage servers
// Limited by time - maximum 15 mins
// Automatically scaled (RAM and CPU)
// Can be run on-demand

// pay per requests and compute time
// can be scaled upto 10GB RAM per function

// AWS Lambda Integration
// Can be integrated with S3, SNS, SQS, Eventbridge, CloudWatch Logs etc

// Synchronous invocation
// After invoking the lambda, it will wait for the result.
// e.g. when a lambda is invoked by a step-function, it is a sysnchronous invokation
// It will wait untill getting the result back from the lambda
// Other examples of synchronous invocation are: CLI, SDK etc
// in synchronous invokation, error handling must happen on client side


// Asynchronous invocation
// in this case, it will invoke the lambda but will not wait for the result.
// so this invocation is faster, as no need to wait for results. Trigger and forget.
// Services that can do asynchronous invocation:
// SNS, S3 event notifications, Cloundwatch Events/ Eventbridge etc
// The events are placed in an internal event queue
// From that event queue, events will trigger the lambda
// In case of failure, lambda will retry 3 times
// So in case of error, we will see duplicate log entries in cloundwatch logs
// We can define a DLQ for failed processing


// EventBridge Rule to trigger lambda
// We can set up CRON or Rate EventBridge Rule to trigger lambda in a particular time or after a given interval
// Need to create event_rule
// Need to create evemt_target
// Need to set up permission so that eventbridge can invoke the target (lambda resource based policy)


// S3 Event Notification to trigger Lambda
// when some object is being uploaded or removed from a S3 Bucket then we can set up S3 bucket to send event to a lambda and trigger it
// Asynchronous invocation
