// Messaging Services
// When we have multiple applications deployed, then these applications need to communicate between themselves
// Communication can be in the following way:
// Direct communication between application to application => Tight coupled => not recommended for suddent spike
// Event based communication => using SQS(queue) and SNS(Pub-sub model) => loose coupled
// SQS + SNS


// SQS - Standard queue
// SQS is fully managed queue(messaging service) offered by AWS
// used to decouple application (EDP and EMOS)
// producer send messages to SQS
// consumer poll messages from SQS
// It can have unlimited no of messages in the queue
// Default retention period => 4 days
// Max retention period => 14 days
// Limitaion of a message => 256KB


// Producer
// using SNS we can send messaged to SQS
// the message is persisted in the queue untill consumer deletes it

// Consumer
// can be lambda, ec2 or on-prem application
// consumer poll SQS for messages (it can receive upto 10 messages at a time)
// The consumer needs to delete the message from SQS after successfully processing it

// SQS queue access policy
// It is required to give access to cross acount or to give accesss to other services to send or poll messages from SQS
// Alternatively, if a service has a role which allows the SQS access, then also it will be able to send or receive messages from SQS

// Visibility Timeout
// When a consumer polls a messages, then the message will become invisible for other consumers
// Due to this visibility timeout
// If the consumer won' be able to process and delete the message within the visibility timeout,
// then the message will be again returned to the queue (we may get duplicate processing)
// So we need to set the visibility timeout by considering all these factors


// Dead Letter Queue
// If a consumer fails to process a message within the visibility timeout, then the message goes back to the queue
// We can set up a limit of how many times a message can return to the queue
// If the limit is exceeded then we can set up a DLQ where the message will go
// Then we can do a manual inspection and debugging of the message
// DLQ of a standard queue must be a Standard queue
// It is advisable to keep retention perid of 14 days in DLQ


// DLQ - Redrive to Source
// Once the consumer code is fixed, then we can redrive the message from DLQ to source queue (or anu other queue)
// And the consumer can process the message

// Delay Seconds
// It is a parameter we can set in the queue level or each message level
//  The messgae which is being produced will be available to consumer after the given delay seconds(maximum 15 mins)
